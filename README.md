    [
      {
        "browserName": "iPhone",
        "platform": "MAC",
        "device": "iPhone 5"

        "browser_version": "17.0",
        "os": "Windows",
        "os_version": "8"
      }
    ]


`test.py <browsers.json> <capability id>` - This file contains the selenium test which would be run in each of the browsers specificed by "browsers.json". 

`run_parallel_tests.py <test.py> <browsers.json>` - This is the runner which runs the tests in parallel.
